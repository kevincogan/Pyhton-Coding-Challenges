# Python Coding Challenges

## Overview

The **Python Coding Challenges** repository is a collection of Python scripts designed to solve a variety of algorithmic and logical problems. These challenges are ideal for practicing Python programming, exploring problem-solving techniques, and enhancing algorithmic thinking.

## Features

- **Diverse Challenges**: Problems range from basic logic puzzles to more advanced computational tasks.
- **Self-Contained Scripts**: Each file represents a unique challenge and can be executed independently.
- **Pythonic Solutions**: Code leverages Python's simplicity and power to provide clean and efficient solutions.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following Python files:

### Example Challenges

1. **DNA.py**: Analyzes DNA sequences for specific patterns or characteristics.
2. **FillTheGap.py**: Solves problems involving missing elements in sequences.
3. **LastDigit.py**: Determines the last digit of a number based on specific criteria.
4. **LetterCount.py**: Counts the occurrence of each letter in a given text.
5. **LocateUniqueHouse.py**: Finds unique elements or objects within a dataset.
6. **OddPairs.py**: Identifies pairs of numbers that meet specific oddness criteria.
7. **PrimeNotPrime.py**: Determines if numbers in a sequence are prime or not.
8. **Snail.py**: Implements algorithms for solving "snail-like" patterns or sequences.
9. **Temperature.py**: Converts and analyzes temperature data.
10. **UpperOrLower.py**: Checks and processes text for uppercase and lowercase letter patterns.
11. **WaterOnSteps.py**: Simulates or calculates water accumulation on steps.
12. **formatInput.py**: Processes and formats user input into the desired structure.
13. **hexadecimalToDecimal.py**: Converts hexadecimal numbers to decimal equivalents.
14. **phoneNumber.py**: Validates and processes phone numbers.
15. **zIndex.py**: Solves problems related to indexing and ranking elements.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A code editor or IDE such as PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevincogan/Python-Coding-Challenges.git
